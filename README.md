-Hi! I'm Michael! I'm a DevOps and CI/CD professional who has designed, written, and implemented multiple pipelines and
applications for both CI/CD and data manipulation. I am an experienced Azure DevOps professional and hold certifications
in Application Development and Continuous Development/Release Orchestration. I am very well-versed in Python, Java, .NET,
yaml, BASH, Git, et al. I am also well-versed in Network Architecture, having on one engagement designed and created the
templatized architecture for a global corporation's connections from Cloud to Ground, including mass-transit connections
to all three major Public Cloud players. I am extremely comfortable working with Palo Alto, Netscreen, and SRX firewalls,
as well as NSX-T's inbuilt distributed firewall (configured via Terraform Go). Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
